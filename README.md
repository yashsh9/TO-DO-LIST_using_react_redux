This is my first early build of a To-Do list application.
Code was written in Visual Studio Code, using JavaScript as the base language.
React JS library was used with Redux for state management.
For now, as primarily this is a frontend project, there is no database storage, the whole storage is local.
The intention was to learn React Redux, hence the design is quite minimalistic. Bootstrap CSS is used here


NOTE: function of editing the tasks is yet to be done and marking the task as completed is also yet to be added soon.
